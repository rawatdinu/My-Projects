                </h3>
                   <p> In the entire World Wide Web, most sites, be it large or small, contain a Contact Us page. 
    The purpose of the Contact Us page is to get your clients or customers to talk to you or inquire more about your services.
     Ultimately, it is to generate potential business for your company. 
     A site contact page may seem insignificant, but it's the only gateway for your visitors to get in touch with you.
</p>
<p>More often than not, the Contact Us page takes up a small fraction of the web site, it usually contains a
 simple form, or in some cases, a hyper linked email and contact number. 
 No matter how simple this page seems, great care and attention should be given to where this link is to be placed,
  what content it should contain or the style of copy writing for that page. Subconsciously,
   these things tend to be overlooked.
   </p>
   <p>
   Including important information on your form would determine the kind of information you will get
    from your client. Know the objectives of your form, and what you aim to find out from them. This 
    is so that you can include them in the forms without having to bounce emails to and fro. This definitely
     helps save time for both parties. You could be a freelancer or running a design agency, but it's always
      good to provide your clients with options like budget and time like the examples above.
